    "# Guided Project: Clean & Analyze Exit Survey \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the DETE exit survey data [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). \n",
    "\n",
    "The original TAFE exit survey data is no longer available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we have been asked by stakeholders to answer to two key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "    - About half of all established employees who resigned, were dissatisffied with their jobs. At a high level, individuals who are employed longer are resigning more due to dissatisfaction. Younger employees who resign are less likely to be dissatisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use both surveys (DETE & TAFE institute) to answer these questions. However, although both institutions used the same survey template, on of them customizes some of the answers. We will work through this to accomplish our analysis goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary:\n",

    "`ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
